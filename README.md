======

repository for all trivia clases and scripts.


This repository has been created to make available the work I have done from scratch, or modified from existing sources to ensure that all code: is available to me in the event of a server failure, is properly version controlled and restorable if I accidentally migrate a change to production without properly backing up the exising file, and so my work can be utilized by other individuals looking to perform similar functions with their own projects.

Contained within here you will see several classes that work together to ensure that all aspects of the trivia messaging system is working and functioning properly.
